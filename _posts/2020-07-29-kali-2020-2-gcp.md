title: Kali 2020.2 on GCP

In a previous post (2019-11-07-kali-gcp), I linked to how I got kali 2019.3 running
on GCP. I'm preparing for the fall semester, and 2019.3 is giving me troubles
with installing new packages from the kali repos because kali is on the rolling
model and 2019.3 is too old, and won't upgrade without yelling. So I'm rewriting
things to build kali 2020.2 via packer. I'll put notes in this post for what I had
to do to get things ready, including for nested vms on kali.

## Kali Preseed.cfg edits
* The new kali disables a root login by default. I re-enabled it.
